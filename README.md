Spatial Epidemiology final project, Fall 2021

# Outcome information 

Outcomes of interest (by source group, census tract):
- 2014 NATA national cancer risk 
- 2014 NATA national respiratory hazard index 
- 2014 NATA national neurological hazard index 
- 2014 NATA national liver hazard index 
- 2014 NATA national kidney hazard index 
- 2014 NATA national immunological hazard index 

Hazard quotient: The rario of the exposure to the substance at the level at which no adverse effects are expected.  <=1 indicates noncancer effect not likely to occur 

Hazard index: The sum of the hazard quotients to toxics that affest the same target organ/target system.  An HI <=1 indicates noncancer effect not likely to occur 

Cancer risk: The probability of contracting cancer over the course of a lifetime, assuming continuous exposure (assumed to be 70 years)

# Exposure information 

Exposure (Aggregated to census tract):
- Redlining 

# Confounders 

We have not identified confounders as redlining is so far in the past, any covariates would be mediators.  We are interested in the total effect and therefore will not be considering these variables. 

# Data editing 

EJScreen data: 
- For ease of importing to GitHub, we limited the data to only areas within GA before loading the dataset to the project
